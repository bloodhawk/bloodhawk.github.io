I have produced and ran an extensive amount of successful production applications utilizing distributed systems and event-driven architectures. 

Some technologies I currently work with are: Git, CI/CD systems, AWS, Docker, NodeJS, Python, Go, Scala, Elixir, React, GraphQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, Solr, Kafka, and others.

Have programmed OO a fair bit but prefer functional programming.

If you want to know more, shoot me a message!

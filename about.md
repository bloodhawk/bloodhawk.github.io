I have produced and ran an extensive amount of successful production applications utilizing distributed systems and event-driven architectures. 

Some technologies I currently work with are: Git, CI/CD systems, AWS, Docker, NodeJS, Python, Go, Scala, Elixir, React, GraphQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, Solr, Kafka, and others.

I work with the belief that you must enable others and mentor them. Most importantly, I surround myself with leaders, not managers. If you want to know more, shoot me a message!
